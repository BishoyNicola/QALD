Dear colleagues,

We are happy to announce QALD-7, the seventh instalment of the open challenge on question answering over linked data. QALD-7 is part of the ESWC satellite events at ESWC 2017 (http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/) and puts a strong focus on multilinguality, hybrid approaches from both structured and unstructured data, Wikidata and large-scale data.

The challenge is aimed at all systems that mediate between a user, expressing his or her information need in natural language (either as question or keywords, provided in seven languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, German, Dutch, Romanian), and RDF data (in this case, DBpedia 2016-04).

A full description of the challenge as well as the training data can be found at the following location:
