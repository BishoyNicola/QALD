The key challenge for Question Answering over Linked Data is to translate a user’s information need into a form such that it can be evaluated using standard Semantic Web query processing and inferencing techniques. The main task of QALD therefore is the following:

Given one or several RDF dataset(s) as well as additional knowledge sources and natural language questions or keywords, return the correct answers or a SPARQL query that retrieves these answers.
In order to focus on specific aspects and challenges, we propose the following three tasks:

Task 1: Multilingual question answering over DBpedia
Task 2: Hybrid question answering
Task 3: Large-Scale question answering over RDF
Task 4: Wikidata-based question answering
